> See? No problem, right?

ariadoa provides a `handle` function, which is a wrapper for functions to make
sending responses easier.

ariadoa also provides a utility function `createResponse` that can be used for
testing Express apps, routers, or middlewares. It is a convenience wrapper over
the excellent [hecks] library.

## Installation

```
npm install @tkesgar/ariadoa
```

> This package requires Node.js v8 or above due to `async`/`await` usage.

## Usage

### handle

### createTestServer

### createTestResponse
